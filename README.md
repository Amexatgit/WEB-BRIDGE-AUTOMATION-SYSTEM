# TE-mini-project
Project about automation in WebBridge

We are building a solution to replace Human interaction for entries at the Webbridge. It is going to be a very simple System that will be fetching the data, like the weight of the entered vehicle, its number plate details, and time of login into the database at real time. 

I'm looking forward to use c++ (we can use Java also if preferred) for component interactions and fetching, and for the database, we can use MySQL 

Hardware components, which I think are required :
1) loadcell (Weighbridge)
2) Microcontroller (to convert Analog values from the load cell to digital values and feed into system)
3) Camera  (number plate scanner) 
4) Wires 
5)battery (5 volts required for the loadcell itself, microcontroller, and camera may need an additional up to 20 volts supply) 
6) sample weights ( as dummy vehicles of 2kg 5kg etc)
7) A bridge-like cardboard structure to place components 
8) A laptop to run the database.
